Exercizes and programming examples and assignments on finite differences/volumes and their use to solve (partial) differential equations. The material serve as an exercize class to the lecture "Numerical Approximation of PDEs by Finite Differences and Finite Volumes" by Prof. Dr. Hendrik Ranocha at Universit√§t Hamburg for the summer semester 2023.
